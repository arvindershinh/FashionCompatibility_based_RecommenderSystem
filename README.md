fashion items, whereas compatible outfits should possess two properties: (i) items should be visually
compatible and share similar style; (ii) these items should form a complete ensemble without
redundancy.

This capstone project was part of Certification Programme at IISc (Team Size 7)
Activities -
+ Executed majority of data preprocessing steps, and feature extraction tasks using pre-trained CNN
model and one hot encoder.
